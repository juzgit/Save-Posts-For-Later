            <p class="para1">
                Football has been a passion of my mine since I was 4 years old. I started with kicking dolls, when I was still in creche.
                Whilst I was waiting for my parents to come pick me up from creche, I used to imagine myself playing in thousands of fans
                in a stadium and I would imagine myself entertain them with the skills I saw on TV, performed by professional footballers
                in Africa and in Europe. Sometimes I would copy the guys in my neighbourhood, they were older than me, playing in the street
                and their games had high intensity, that I could not keep up with them when I was watching them play. I was the youngest in my 
                neighbourhood, so I had no choice to play with them and learn from them. It took me a while to get to hold my own ground, I was lacking
                physicality, I had no pace and no body strength. My football skills and football iq only took me so far and I struggled with matching 
                their intensity. My football iq was just flashly skills and how to pass the, I was limited in that department.

                Fast forward two years later, the 2010 World Cup South Africa, I had the opportunity to watch the best players
                in the world play on home soil the likes of Messi, Ronaldo, Robinho (whom I model my game after), Drogba and Wayne Rooney to just to name a few.
                I was 6 years old it was a fever dream and I enjoyed the atomsphere in the country and in my neighbourhood, I had no idea football
                had such an impact on people. I just knew the players names and I did not know any of the teams/countries that were playing in the country
                so I did not watch majority of the games. It was such a shame that I did not get the opportunity to watch Ronaldinho play.

                I remember my first goal in street football, it was similar to Maicon's near post finish against Korea DPR in the 2010 World Cup and it was during
                the World Cup, I was telling my friends he copied my goal when I saw it happen.

                My favourite thing about football is that it can be anywhere and it is a non-verbal language between people. Our
                skills do the talking when we are playing and the rest is just shouting football terms amongst each other. It is one
                of the easiet ways to make friends and get along with people, the sport does that.

                In the future I want to reinvest in the sport, give opportunities to children to be the next big thing. I want future
                children to get the feeling that I had watching when I was watching my favourite players
